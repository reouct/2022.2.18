      <h1>Golden State Warriors</h1>
      <p>
        [The Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team
        based in San Francisco. The Warriors compete in the National Basketball
        Association (NBA), as a member of the league's Western Conference
        Pacific Division. Founded in 1946 in Philadelphia, the Warriors moved to
        the San Francisco Bay Area in 1962 and took the city's name, before
        changing its geographic moniker to Golden State in 1971.[a][b] The club
        plays its home games at the Chase Center. The Warriors won the inaugural
        Basketball Association of America (BAA) championship in 1947,[c] and won
        again in 1956, led by Hall of Fame trio Paul Arizin, Tom Gola, and Neil
        Johnston. After the trade of star Wilt Chamberlain in January 1965, the
        team finished the 1964–65 season with the NBA's worst record (17–63).
        Their rebuilding period was brief due in large part to the Warriors
        drafting of Rick Barry four months after the trade. In 1975, star
        players Barry and Jamaal Wilkes powered the Warriors to their third
        championship, widely considered one of the biggest upsets in NBA
        history.]
